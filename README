About
-----
FileBrowser is an application for Android. It's based on Moo Production
FileBrowser ( http://code.google.com/p/filebrowserandroid/ ) licensde under BSD
License. Some Parts of Moo Production FileBrowser were rewritten, some were
addded. All my contribution to FileBrowser is also licensed under BSD License.
It could be possible that my patches would be merged with Moo Productions
code, but i have yet no response from them (mailed few days ago). Because i
needed some place on the net were  i can store it, it's for starters saved here
on github.
